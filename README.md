# QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT with Qiskit

This repository contains script to run a quantum entanglement simulation using _Qiskit_ (might be run on quantum or basic computer).

## HADAMARD GATE

**HADAMARD GATE** is a single-qubit gate that creates superposition states in quantum computing circuits. 
In hadamard gate |Ψ> = (|00> + |11>) / sqrt2 _and_ |Ψ> = (|0...0> + |1...1>) / sqrt2 in GHZ state.
Here is a small graph of it`s work:

## QUBITS

Number of qubits and shots can be modified to get the result you want (in my case I used 4).
